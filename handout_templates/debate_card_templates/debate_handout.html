  <h1>Debate Preparation Sheet</h1>
  <div class="sub">Use this sheet to structure your team's case. The italic text provides examples.</div>

  <!-- === TEAM PREPARATION (SHARED) === -->
  <div class="prep-section">
    <h2>1. Team Foundation</h2>
    <p><strong>Motion:</strong></p>
    <p class="sub example"><em>Example: Should schools require students to wear uniforms?</em></p>
    <div class="prep-box"></div>
    <p><strong>Our Team's Thesis (one clear sentence):</strong></p>
    <p class="sub example"><em>Example: Requiring school uniforms promotes equality and reduces social pressure, creating a better learning environment for all students.</em></p>
    <div class="prep-box large-box"></div>
  </div>

  <div class="prep-section">
    <h2>2. Prepared Rebuttals</h2>
    <p><strong>What we EXPECT the other team to argue:</strong></p>
    <p class="sub example"><em>Example: That uniforms are expensive to buy all at once.</em></p>
    <div class="prep-box"></div>
    <p><strong>How we will respond if they do:</strong></p>
    <p class="sub example"><em>Example: We will respond by arguing that the long-term cost is lower than buying trendy clothes all year, and that schools can offer financial support.</em></p>
    <div class="prep-box"></div>
  </div>

  <!-- === SPEAKER 1: OPENER === -->
  <h1>Speaker 1: Opener</h1>
  <div class="prep-section">
    <h2>Main Argument (SEAL)</h2>
    <p><strong>Statement:</strong></p>
    <p class="sub example"><em>Example: Uniforms reduce bullying related to clothing and brands.</em></p>
    <div class="prep-box"></div>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <p class="sub example"><em>Example: In many schools, students feel pressured to wear expensive, brand-name clothes. Those who cannot afford them are often excluded or teased.</em></p>
    <div class="prep-box"></div>
    <p><strong>Argument (Why this matters):</strong></p>
    <p class="sub example"><em>Example: This creates a safer, more inclusive school environment where students can focus on their studies instead of their social status.</em></p>
    <div class="prep-box"></div>
    <p><strong>Link (How this proves our thesis):</strong></p>
    <p class="sub example"><em>Example: Therefore, by removing this source of social pressure, uniforms help create the equal and positive learning environment our thesis calls for.</em></p>
    <div class="prep-box"></div>
  </div>

  <!-- === SPEAKER 2: BUILDER === -->
  <h1>Speaker 2: Builder</h1>
  <div class="prep-section">
    <h2>Live Rebuttal</h2>
    <p><strong>Notes on their Opener's argument:</strong></p>
    <div class="prep-box"></div>
    <p><strong>My response (They said... But... Because... Therefore...):</strong></p>
    <p class="sub example"><em>Example: The Negative team argued that uniforms limit self-expression. However, students can express their identity through their ideas and personalities, not just their clothes.</em></p>
    <div class="prep-box"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="prep-section">
    <h2>New Argument (SEAL)</h2>
    <p><strong>New Statement:</strong></p>
    <p class="sub example"><em>Example: School uniforms save families time and money.</em></p>
    <div class="prep-box"></div>
    <p><strong>New Example:</strong></p>
    <p class="sub example"><em>Example: Instead of buying many different outfits, parents only need to purchase a few sets of the same approved uniform.</em></p>
    <div class="prep-box"></div>
  </div>

  <!-- === SPEAKER 3: CLOSER === -->
  <h1>Speaker 3: Closer</h1>
  <div class="prep-section">
    <h2>Summary & Weighing</h2>
    <p><strong>Clash Point 1* (e.g., "Equality vs. Freedom"):</strong></p>
    <p class="sub example"><em>Example: We showed that our focus on equality creates a safer school, while they argued for a type of freedom that leads to bullying. Our principle is more important in a school setting.</em></p>
    <div class="prep-box"></div>
    <p><strong>Clash Point 2* (e.g., "Cost"):</strong></p>
    <p class="sub example"><em>Example: They said uniforms are expensive, but we proved the long-term cost is lower for families.</em></p>
    <div class="prep-box"></div>
    <p><strong>Final Summary (Why our case is stronger overall):</strong></p>
    <p class="sub example"><em>Example: Because we have proven that uniforms create a safer and more equal environment, and also save families money, our case is stronger and more practical.</em></p>
    <div class="prep-box large-box"></div>
