  <!-- === OPENING THE ROUND === -->
  <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>Opening Script</h2>
    <p>"Good afternoon. This round follows the six-speech format: three speakers per side, two minutes each. During Builder and Closer speeches, the opposing team may offer one 10-second Point of Information. After the closers, we will hold a five-minute POI stage with alternating questions. Judges will score clarity and argument strength, not personal opinion. The motion reads: <b>[insert motion here].</b> We now begin."</p>
