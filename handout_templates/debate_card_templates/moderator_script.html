    <h2>Opening Script</h2>
    <p>"Good afternoon. This round follows the six-speech format: three speakers per side. Openers have two minutes, Builders and Closers have three minutes each. During Builder speeches only, the opposing team may offer one 10-second Point of Information. After the closers, we will hold a five-minute POI stage with alternating questions. Judges will score clarity and argument strength, not personal opinion.</p>

  <!-- === DEBATE TOPIC INTRODUCTIONS === -->
  <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>Debate Topic Introductions</h2>
    <p class="sub">Read the appropriate introduction aloud before stating the motion. This provides essential context and frames the ethical stakes.</p>

    <h3>1. Survival Cannibalism</h3>
    <p><b>Introduction:</b> "In rare disasters, people have survived by consuming those who had already died. This raises a difficult choice: is keeping someone alive more important than protecting the dignity of the dead and the peace of the grave? The law against desecrating the dead reflects a societal value that human remains are not mere things. Swedish law protects human remains under <i>gravfridsbrott</i>, while the necessity defense allows exemptions when emergency action prevents serious harm."</p>
    <p><b>Motion:</b> Should Swedish law excuse consumption of human remains in extreme survival situations where no killing occurs?</p>

    <h3>2. Death Penalty</h3>
    <p><b>Introduction:</b> "While Sweden has abolished the death penalty, this debate re-examines the core question. It pits the demand for absolute justice against the principle that a state should not have the authority to kill. Proponents argue it is the only proportionate response to heinous crimes. Opponents argue it is an unacceptable violation of human rights that carries the unforgivable risk of executing an innocent person, even with modern forensics."</p>
    <p><b>Motion:</b> Should the state have the power to impose the death penalty for the most serious crimes?</p>

    <h3>3. Gene Editing</h3>
    <p><b>Introduction:</b> "Gene-editing tools like CRISPR give us the power to correct errors in our DNA that cause devastating inherited diseases like Huntington's or cystic fibrosis. This raises a profound ethical question: should we use this power on human embryos to prevent such conditions before a child is even born? Supporters argue it is a moral duty to prevent suffering when we can. Opponents warn that we are crossing a dangerous line by making permanent changes to the human gene pool for generations who cannot consent."</p>
    <p><b>Motion:</b> Should Sweden allow parents to use gene editing to prevent serious diseases in embryos?</p>

    <h3>4. Healthcare Rationing</h3>
    <p><b>Introduction:</b> "During severe medical crises, hospitals may face impossible choices about who receives life-saving treatment when resources are scarce. Age-based prioritization raises fundamental questions about the value of life and fairness in healthcare allocation. Some argue younger patients have more life-years to gain, while others contend that age-based criteria violate the principle of equal dignity."</p>
    <p><b>Motion:</b> Should hospitals prioritize younger patients over older patients for life-saving treatment during a severe shortage?</p>

    <h3>5. Organ Donation</h3>
    <p><b>Introduction:</b> "Thousands die each year waiting for organ transplants. An opt-out system would presume consent for organ donation unless individuals actively refuse, potentially saving many lives. However, this shifts the default from individual autonomy to state presumption. The question becomes whether the urgent need for organs justifies removing the requirement for explicit consent and family input."</p>
    <p><b>Motion:</b> Should all adults be treated as organ donors at death unless they have opted out, with no family veto?</p>

    <h3>6. Abortion</h3>
    <p><b>Introduction:</b> "The abortion debate centers on a fundamental conflict: when does the state's interest in protecting potential life override an individual's right to bodily autonomy? Supporters of abortion rights argue that forcing someone to continue an unwanted pregnancy violates their fundamental freedoms. Opponents argue that a fetus has moral status that the law must protect, even before birth."</p>
    <p><b>Motion:</b> Should the law prioritize a person's right to choose over the potential life of a fetus?</p>

    <h3>7. Citizenship Tests</h3>
    <p><b>Introduction:</b> "Many countries require citizenship tests covering language, history, and civic values. Supporters argue these ensure integration and shared national identity. Critics contend such tests create unfair barriers, may not accurately measure commitment to a country, and risk excluding worthy candidates based on test performance rather than actual contribution to society."</p>
    <p><b>Motion:</b> Should Sweden add mandatory Swedish and civics tests and a pledge of allegiance as conditions for naturalization?</p>
