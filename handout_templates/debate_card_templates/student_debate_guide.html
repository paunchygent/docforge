  <h1>Student Debate Guide</h1>
  <div class="sub">Concise reference for prepping, speaking, and judging practice rounds.</div>

  <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>Format &amp; Timing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Teams:</b> Affirmative versus Negative, three speakers each &#8212; six speeches total.</li>
      <li><b>Order:</b> Aff Opener → Neg Opener → Aff Builder → Neg Builder → Aff Closer → Neg Closer.</li>
      <li><b>Length:</b> Each speech lasts 3:00. Use 1:00 versions in drills to sharpen structure.</li>
      <li><b>POIs:</b> Optional. Maximum two per team per speech, ≤10 seconds. The speaker may accept or decline.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>Speaker Conduct</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Respect:</b> Interrupt only for POIs. Stay polite even under pressure.</li>
      <li><b>Timing:</b> Finish when the signal sounds; a clean close sounds confident.</li>
      <li><b>Delivery:</b> Use a steady voice, eye contact, and grounded posture to boost credibility.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>Addressing Audience &amp; Opponents</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Audience first:</b> Frame arguments to the judges and room before turning to the opposing team.</li>
      <li><b>Language:</b> Use phrases such as “This team argues…” instead of personal names.</li>
            <li><b>Signposting:</b> Use connectors (firstly, however, therefore, to conclude) to highlight structure.</li>
      <li><b>Clarity:</b> Keep sentences short with one idea each to aid ESL listeners. This will also help you stay focused on your main points.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>Speaker Roles</h2>
    <h3>Opener</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>State the thesis in one sentence and define key terms if needed.</li>
      <li>Deliver one SEAL point (Statement → Example → Argument [why it matters] → Link back to the motion).</li>
      <li>Include at least two spoken connectors to guide listeners.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Builder</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a fresh SEAL point with a new example that reinforces the team line.</li>
      <li>Handle one priority rebuttal (respond to their main point) without taking focus from your main extension (your new argument).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Closer</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Summarise the team’s stance, weighing your strongest points against theirs.</li>
      <li>Deliver concise rebuttal and finish with the thesis line.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>Building Every Speech</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use SEAL at least once; always state the Link back to the motion.</li>
      <li>Choose examples you can explain in two lines rather than just naming sources.</li>
      <li>Verbalise at least two connectors to signal transitions.</li>
      <li>Body language (stance, hands, eye contact) should underline the argument, not distract.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>Points of Information (POIs)</h2>
    <p>POIs are short questions (≤10 seconds) offered to the speaker by the opposing team. Their purpose is to challenge a point or force clarification.</p>
    <h4>As the Speaker:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You may accept or decline a POI. It is wise to accept at least one.</li>
      <li>To accept, say "Yes, please" or simply gesture. To decline, wave a hand dismissively.</li>
      <li>Answer the question concisely (in one sentence), then return immediately to your speech.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>As the Asker:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Stand and say, "Point of information."</li>
      <li>If accepted, ask your single, clear question.</li>
      <li>Sit down as soon as you have finished asking.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>Rebuttals: Prepared vs. Live</h2>
    <p>A rebuttal is a response to an argument from the opposing team. Your goal is to show why their point is wrong, irrelevant, or less important than yours. There are two types:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Prepared Rebuttals:</b> These are arguments you prepare in advance for points you <em>expect</em> the other team to make (see the "Rebuttal sheet" in the checklist).</li>
      <li><b>Live (Tailored) Rebuttals:</b> These are direct responses to the <em>specific</em> arguments the other team actually makes during the debate. Winning debates requires good live rebuttals.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>When to Rebut</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Rebuttals are usually delivered at the <strong>start of a speech</strong>, before you introduce your own new arguments.</li>
      <li>The <strong>Builder</strong> speakers should rebut the previous speaker before building their own case.</li>
      <li><strong>Closer</strong> speakers focus heavily on rebuttal to show why your side won.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>How to Structure a Live Rebuttal (4 Steps)</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>"They Said..."</strong> — Briefly and fairly state the argument you are responding to.</li>
      <li><strong>"But We Disagree..."</strong> — State your direct counter-argument.</li>
      <li><strong>"Because..."</strong> — Explain why you are right, using logic or an example.</li>
      <li><strong>"Therefore..."</strong> — Explain the impact of your rebuttal on the debate (e.g., "...therefore, their point about cost is invalid and our plan remains the best option.").</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>Questions from Chair or Judges</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Answer in two lines: give a clear claim, then a reason supporting it.</li>
      <li>Keep tone calm and formal; treat questions as a chance to reinforce your case.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>Audience &amp; Judge Focus</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the judge score card to track clarity, structure, and the evidence you actually understood.</li>
      <li>Note signposting, rhetorical devices, and links back to the motion to see who stays on task.</li>
      <li>Observe how teams handle POIs, rebuttals, and maintain poise and presence under time pressure.</li>
      <li>Choose the side with the clearer, better-supported case &#8212; not the loudest delivery.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="guide-section">
