  <h1>Student Debate Guide</h1>
  <div class="sub">Concise reference for prepping, speaking, and judging practice rounds.</div>

  <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>Format &amp; Timing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Teams:</b> Affirmative versus Negative, three speakers each &#8212; six speeches total.</li>
      <li><b>Order:</b> Aff Opener → Neg Opener → Aff Builder → Neg Builder → Aff Closer → Neg Closer.</li>
      <li><b>Length:</b> Each speech lasts 3:00. Use 1:00 versions in drills to sharpen structure.</li>
      <li><b>POIs:</b> Optional. Maximum two per team per speech, ≤10 seconds. The speaker may accept or decline.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>Speaker Conduct</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Respect:</b> Interrupt only for POIs. Stay polite even under pressure.</li>
      <li><b>Timing:</b> Finish when the signal sounds; a clean close sounds confident.</li>
      <li><b>Delivery:</b> Use a steady voice, eye contact, and grounded posture to boost credibility.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>Addressing Audience &amp; Opponents</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Audience first:</b> Frame arguments to the judges and room before turning to the opposing team.</li>
      <li><b>Language:</b> Use phrases such as “This team argues…” instead of personal names.</li>
      <li><b>Signposting:</b> Deploy connectors (firstly, however, therefore, to conclude) to highlight structure.</li>
      <li><b>Clarity:</b> Keep sentences short with one idea each to aid ESL listeners.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>Speaker Roles</h2>
    <h3>Opener</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>State the thesis in one sentence and define key terms if needed.</li>
      <li>Deliver one SEAL point (Statement → Example → Argument → Link back to the motion).</li>
      <li>Include at least two spoken connectors to guide listeners.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Builder</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a fresh SEAL point with a new example that reinforces the team line.</li>
      <li>Handle one priority rebuttal without derailing your main extension.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Closer</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Summarise the team’s stance, weighing your strongest points against theirs.</li>
      <li>Deliver concise rebuttal and finish with the thesis line.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>Building Every Speech</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use SEAL at least once; always state the Link back to the motion.</li>
      <li>Choose examples you can explain in two lines rather than just naming sources.</li>
      <li>Verbalise at least two connectors to signal transitions.</li>
      <li>Body language (stance, hands, eye contact) should underline the argument, not distract.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>Points of Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Purpose:</b> Short questions or challenges that expose gaps or force clarification.</li>
      <li><b>As speaker:</b> Accept only if it helps you; respond in one sentence, then resume your structure.</li>
      <li><b>As asker:</b> Stand, say “Point of information,” ask one clear question (≤10 s), then sit.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>Live Rebuttals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Aim to show a point is wrong, weak, or less important than yours.</li>
      <li>Use a mini-SEAL rebuttal: Statement (“That ignores…”), Example, Argument, Link.</li>
      <li>Practice quick thinking so surprises do not break your structure.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>Questions from Chair or Judges</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Answer in two lines: give a clear claim, then a reason supporting it.</li>
      <li>Keep tone calm and formal; treat questions as a chance to reinforce your case.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>Audience &amp; Judge Focus</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the judge score card to track clarity, structure, and the evidence you actually understood.</li>
      <li>Note signposting, rhetorical devices, and links back to the motion to see who stays on task.</li>
      <li>Observe how teams handle POIs, rebuttals, and maintain poise and presence under time pressure.</li>
      <li>Choose the side with the clearer, better-supported case &#8212; not the loudest delivery.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>Quick Prep Checklist</h2>
    <ul class="checklist">
      <li>Thesis line drafted and agreed.</li>
      <li>Three SEAL points mapped to Opener, Builder, Closer roles.</li>
      <li>Rebuttal sheet filled: “They will say…” / “Our reply…”</li>
      <li>Two connectors you will actually say, highlighted.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <p>Use this guide before, during, and after practice debates to keep structure tight and teams aligned.</p>
