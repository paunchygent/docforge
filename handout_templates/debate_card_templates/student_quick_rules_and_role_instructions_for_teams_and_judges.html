  <h1>Student Reference — When You Debate</h1>
  <div class="sub">Essential rules, phrases, and conduct for live debate rounds.</div>

  <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>Opening Your Speech</h2>
    <p><b>Standard opening:</b> "Honourable judges, members of the house, good [morning/afternoon]. As the [Affirmative/Negative] [Opener/Builder/Closer], I will [outline/rebut and extend/summarize and weigh] our case on the motion before the house."</p>
  </section>

  <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>Conduct & Timing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Address opponents:</b> "This team argues…" or "the opposing team" (never names)</li>
      <li><b>Timing:</b> 2:00 per speech · 1 bell at 1:40 · 2 bells at 2:00 · Cut off at 2:15</li>
      <li><b>POI window:</b> During Builder/Closer speeches only, 0:20–1:40</li>
      <li><b>Formality:</b> Stay polite; no personal attacks or interruptions except POIs</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>Points of Information (POIs)</h2>
    <p><b>Offering:</b> Stand, say "Point of information," ask one clear question (≤10 seconds), sit down. During each Builder/Closer speech, the opposing team gets one attempt.</p>
    <p><b>Responding:</b> Accept ("Yes, please") or decline (wave hand). Answer in one sentence, return to speech. After the closers, alternate 5:00 of POIs (≤10 seconds each, max one follow-up).</p>
  </section>

  <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>Useful Phrases</h2>
    <p><b>Signposting:</b> "Firstly… However… Therefore… To conclude…"</p>
    <p><b>Rebuttal:</b> "They said… But we disagree because… Therefore…"</p>
    <p><b>Weighing:</b> "Our case is stronger because… Even if their argument is true, ours matters more because…"</p>
  </section>

  <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>Team Communication During the Debate</h2>
    <p><b>Computer access:</b> Only the <b>Opener</b> may use a computer during the debate to research and suggest rebuttals for the Builder and Closer. Keep computer use minimal—it is rude and improper to not listen and engage with the debate.</p>
    <p><b>Passing notes:</b> All team members may take notes and pass them to teammates. All suggestions must be communicated through written notes only.</p>
    <p><b>No talking:</b> No talking or whispering is allowed during speeches. Keep verbal communication to an absolute minimum during short pauses between speeches.</p>

  <!-- === WHEN YOU JUDGE === -->
  <h1>Student Reference — When You Judge</h1>
  <div class="sub">Decide which team made the stronger case, not which side you agree with. Score objectively using the rubric on your Judge's Score Card.</div>

  <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>How to Judge Fairly & Objectively</h2>
    <h3>Before the Debate</h3>
    <p>Read the <b>Debate Card</b> for the motion being debated. Understand the key questions, core clash, main arguments, and vocabulary. This helps you follow the debate and recognize strong reasoning.</p>
    
    <h3>During the Debate</h3>
    <p>Use the <b>rubric on your Judge's Score Card</b> to score both teams on five criteria: Case & Thesis, Argument Strength, Rebuttal & Clash, Structure & Teamwork, and POI Handling. Score based on performance, not on which side you personally agree with.</p>
    
    <h3>Taking Notes</h3>
    <p>Write down each team's main points, rebuttals, and examples. Note strengths and weaknesses in their reasoning. Keep notes professional and impersonal—they are for you to decide the winner, not as feedback to the teams.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>How to Decide</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Add up scores for each team (max 15 points)</li>
      <li>Review your notes and overall impression of each team's performance</li>
      <li>The higher score is a strong indicator of the stronger case, but use your notes and judgment to confirm—especially if scores are close or tied</li>
      <li>If you decide the team with the lower score won, you must clearly explain why in your decision reason</li>
      <li>Write your decision reason on the score card</li>
      <li>Hand the completed score card to the moderator</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="sub">The moderator will announce the winner based on your assessment. Your score card will also be used to evaluate your understanding of rhetoric and proficiency as an evaluator.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="guide-section">
    <h2>Judge Conduct</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Stay silent during speeches (no reactions or comments)</li>
      <li>Take notes on main points, rebuttals, and clash</li>
      <li>Look for: clarity, evidence, direct responses, weighing, teamwork</li>
      <li>Be respectful—acknowledge both teams' effort</li>
    </ul>
