# Debate Foundations

**Core Knowledge for Team Debates**

---

## What is a Debate?

A **structured argument** between two teams:

- **Affirmative** (YES) supports the motion
- **Negative** (NO) opposes the motion

**Goal:** Convince the judge your side is stronger using logic, evidence, and clear communication.

**Not about:** Who speaks louder or who you personally agree with.

## The Format: 6 Speeches, 2 Minutes Each

| Order | Speaker Role | Main Job |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | **Aff Opener** | State thesis + 1 argument |
| 2 | **Neg Opener** | State thesis + 1 argument |
| 3 | **Aff Builder** | Rebut + add new argument |
| 4 | **Neg Builder** | Rebut + add new argument |
| 5 | **Aff Closer** | Summarize + weigh your case |
| 6 | **Neg Closer** | Summarize + weigh your case |

**Each speech:** 2:00 minutes (1:00 in drills)

---

## The Three Speaker Roles

### **Opener** (Speaker 1)

- State your team's **thesis** in one sentence
- Deliver **one strong argument** using SEAL
- Set the foundation for your team

### **Builder** (Speaker 2)

- **Rebut** the other team's Opener
- Add **one new argument** to extend your case
- Balance attack and construction

### **Closer** (Speaker 3)

- **Summarize** your team's strongest points
- **Weigh** why your case is stronger than theirs
- Finish with your thesis line

---

## SEAL: The Argument Structure

Every argument needs **four parts**:

**S** — **Statement:** Your claim in one sentence  
*"School uniforms reduce bullying related to clothing."*

**E** — **Example:** A concrete illustration  
*"Students feel pressured to wear expensive brands. Those who can't afford them are often excluded."*

**A** — **Argument:** Why this matters  
*"This creates a safer, more inclusive environment where students focus on studies, not status."*

**L** — **Link:** Connect back to the motion  
*"Therefore, uniforms create the equal learning environment we need."*

---

## Rebuttals: Responding to the Other Side

**Two types:**

1. **Prepared Rebuttals:** Arguments you expect them to make  
   *(Plan these before the debate)*

2. **Live Rebuttals:** Responses to what they actually say  
   *(The Builder and Closer must do this)*

---

## The 4-Step Rebuttal Structure

**1. "They Said..."**  
Fairly summarize their argument.

**2. "But We Disagree..."**  
State your counter-argument.

**3. "Because..."**  
Explain why you're right (logic or example).

**4. "Therefore..."**  
Show the impact on the debate.

---

## Example Rebuttal

**Motion:** Should schools require uniforms?

**They Said:** *"Uniforms limit self-expression."*

**But We Disagree:** *Students can express identity through ideas and personality, not just clothes.*

**Because:** *True self-expression comes from what you say and do, not what brand you wear.*

**Therefore:** *Their point about freedom is less important than the equality and safety uniforms provide.*

---

## Points of Information (POIs)

**Short questions** (≤10 seconds) to challenge the speaker.

### **As the Speaker:**

- You may **accept or decline**. During Builder/Closer speeches expect at most one POI from the opposing team.
- Answer in **one sentence**, then return to your speech. In the final 5:00 POI stage, alternate responses and keep answers within 10 seconds.

### **As the Asker:**

- Stand and say: *"Point of information"*
- If accepted, ask **one clear question**. During Builder/Closer speeches you get one attempt; in the final stage, alternate requests and take only one follow-up.
- Sit down immediately after asking

**Purpose:** Test the logic of their argument, not to interrupt rudely.

---

## Strategic POIs: Examples

**Good POIs** expose weaknesses or force clarification:

- *"If life begins at conception, should IVF embryos have the same legal rights?"*
- *"If deterrence works, why do countries with the death penalty still have high crime rates?"*
- *"If bodily autonomy is absolute, should there be any time limit on abortion?"*

**Bad POIs** are vague, polarizing, or too long:

- ❌ *"Don't you think that's just wrong?"*
- ❌ *"How can you possibly defend that position given all the evidence that..."*

---

## Signposting: Guide Your Listeners

Use **connectors** to show structure:

**Sequencing:**  
*"Firstly... Secondly... Finally..."*

**Contrasting:**  
*"However... On the other hand... Nevertheless..."*

**Concluding:**  
*"Therefore... To conclude... This proves that..."*

**Why?** ESL listeners (and judges!) need clear signals to follow your argument.

---

## The Thesis: Your Team's Core Claim

**One clear sentence** that states your position.

### Examples

**Motion:** Should the state have the power to impose the death penalty?

**Affirmative Thesis:**  
*"The death penalty is the only proportionate response to the most heinous crimes and ensures justice for victims."*

**Negative Thesis:**  
*"The death penalty violates fundamental human rights and carries an unacceptable risk of executing innocent people."*

---

## Weighing: Why Your Case is Stronger

**Weighing** = comparing your arguments to theirs.

### Three ways to weigh

1. **Magnitude:** Our impact is bigger  
   *"Saving lives is more important than saving money."*

2. **Probability:** Our outcome is more likely  
   *"There's no proof their plan works, but ours has succeeded in 12 countries."*

3. **Values:** Our principle matters more  
   *"Human rights must come before efficiency."*

---

## Clash Points: Where You Disagree

**Clash** = direct conflict between your arguments and theirs.

### Example

**Motion:** Should schools require uniforms?

**Clash Point 1: Equality vs. Freedom**  

- **Affirmative:** Uniforms create equality and reduce bullying  
- **Negative:** Uniforms limit self-expression and freedom

**Clash Point 2: Cost**  

- **Affirmative:** Uniforms save money long-term  
- **Negative:** Uniforms are expensive upfront

**The Closer's job:** Explain why your side wins each clash.

---

## Key Rhetorical Concepts

### **Slippery Slope**

*Warning that one action will lead to a chain of bad consequences.*  
*"If we allow this exception, it will normalize the behavior."*

### **Bright-Line Rule**

*A clear, simple rule with no room for interpretation.*  
*"The death penalty is never acceptable" vs. "It's acceptable with strict safeguards."*

### **Burden of Proof**

*Who must prove their claim?*  
*"Must we prove the death penalty is necessary, or must they prove it's safe?"*

---

## Domain-Specific Vocabulary

Each debate topic has **core terms** you must understand:

**Abortion:**  
bodily autonomy, personhood, right to life, viability, conception

**Death Penalty:**  
sanctity of life, deterrence, retributive justice, wrongful conviction, life without parole

**Healthcare Rationing:**  
triage, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), distributive justice

**Use these terms** to show you understand the topic deeply.

## How to Prepare: The Prep Planner

**Before the debate, your team must:**

1. **Write your thesis** (one sentence)
2. **Plan 3 SEAL arguments** (one per speaker)
3. **Prepare rebuttals** ("They will say... / We will respond...")
4. **Choose connectors** you'll actually say
5. **Practice timing** (3:00 per speech)

**Use the Debate Preparation Sheet** to organize this work.

---

## How Judges Score You

Judges evaluate **5 criteria** (1-3 points each):

1. **Case & Thesis:** Clear, consistent, proven?
2. **Argument Strength (SEAL):** Well-supported with examples?
3. **Rebuttal & Clash:** Did you challenge their points effectively?
4. **Structure & Teamwork:** Did each speaker fulfill their role?
5. **Points of Information:** Did you ask/handle POIs well?

**Winner:** The team with the **stronger case**, not the loudest delivery.

---

## Delivery Tips

### **Voice & Body Language:**

- Steady voice, eye contact, grounded posture
- Use hands to emphasize, not distract

### **Respect:**

- Interrupt only for POIs
- Stay polite under pressure
- Address "this team" not personal names

### **Timing:**

- Finish when the signal sounds
- A clean close sounds confident

---

## The Learning Cycle

### **Before:**

1. Read the **Debate Card** for your topic
2. Use the **Prep Planner** to structure your case
3. Practice with your team (timing + connectors)

### **During:**

1. Follow your role (Opener/Builder/Closer)
2. Take notes on their arguments for live rebuttals
3. Accept at least one POI

### **After:**

1. Review the **Judge's Score Card**
2. Identify what worked and what to improve
3. Apply lessons to the next debate

## Core Principles to Remember

1. **Focus on the ethical dilemma**, not technical details
2. **Both sides have strong arguments** — your job is to prove yours is stronger
3. **Structure matters** — SEAL, rebuttals, signposting
4. **Clarity beats complexity** — short sentences, one idea each
5. **Weigh, don't just argue** — explain why your case wins

## Questions?

**Common concerns:**

*"What if I forget my speech?"*  
→ Use your prep sheet. Judges value clear thinking over memorization.

*"What if they make an argument we didn't prepare for?"*  
→ Use the 4-step rebuttal structure: They said... But... Because... Therefore...

*"What if I don't know a word in the glossary?"*  
→ Ask before the debate. The glossary is there to help you learn.

**Now go practice!**
