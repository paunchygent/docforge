# Giffords' Circus

In 2000, Nell Gifford started an old-fashioned touring circus that has become a British favourite. Making this dream come true, from next to nothing, was a struggle in many ways. This is her story about how it happened.

Growing up in rural Wiltshire, my sister and I put on a circus for our friends. We borrowed the church tent and adorned it with cardboard flowers and stars. Our act included a Shetland pony and cart, a performing dog called Rags and a sheep.

Little did I imagine then, as a nine-year-old girl, that I would one day join the circus for real. By the time I decided to do that, in my 20s, I had just graduated from Oxford. Many circus people laughed when I started my own show with good old-fashioned acts, including jugglers and Cossack horsemen.

And yet, for many summers now, following a tradition common in the English countryside before the arrival of radio, cinema and TV, I've taken on the road a vintage circus that has entertained more than 200,000 people.

Without fail, each show throws up some lost fragment of my own happy childhood, memories of which were slowly rubbed out from the moment my mother fell from her horse in November 1991 and was seriously injured. Ironically enough, it was this accident that set me on the road to the circus.

At the time, I was 18 and due to go to Oxford to read English. Instead, I took a gap year and travelled to America, where my brother knew the owners of the touring show Circus Flora. I spent a month there, painting the lorries and riding a horse in the parade. I saw a happy place where children and animals played together in the sunshine, and the workplace was a huge, candy-striped tent, full of music.

I returned home, and three years later I joined the first show that came to town. For the next couple of years, I worked for different circuses, riding Arab horses and elephants, and wearing top hat and tails as a ring-mistress. But I was also driving lorries, swinging sledgehammers, and raking sawdust.

Struggling through mud in the middle of the night, my throat burning with the fumes of elephant pee, wasn't exactly what I had in mind. Neither was doing publicity parades around supermarkets to promote business – but the mid-90s was a bad time for circus in England. Shows were in decline, morale among circus people was low, and I felt the demoralisation of performances attended by only 20 or 30 people.

It wasn't until 1998, when I got a job with the Circus Roncalli in Germany, that I discovered that continental Europe had a celebrated circus culture. There, the public poured through gilded turnstiles to be thrilled by the grand circus dynasties: Bougliones, Caroli, Gruss – families who danced on galloping horses and leapt through flaming hoops, clad in exquisite costumes designed in Vienna.

Returning home, I wanted to breathe new life into the art of circus in Britain, and I shared my dream with a tall, curly-haired boy named Toti Gifford, a landscape gardener whom I'd met in Cheltenham between tours.

We married in 1999 and immediately started our own circus. We had no equipment or backing, but we did have a deadline, after I persuaded the organisers of the Hay-on-Wye Literary Festival that their line-up for May 2000 should include Giffords' Circus, as we had decided it should be called. I said there would be showgirls, a dancing horse and a raucous atmosphere lit by gaslight.

## What promises!

We set about fulfilling these promises from scratch in our 'office', the garden shed of our cottage in Gloucestershire. To help fund the project, I started fruit-picking at a local farm. After the day was over, we'd sit in the fields drinking cider, watching sparks fly up from the fire. It was a carefree autumn but we were putting all our time and money into the circus and running into heavy debt. We sold our car, and at one point Toti's sister had to give us £50 for food.

Eventually, we couldn't afford the rent on our cottage, and had to move into the old showman's wagon that we'd intended to be our home on tour. Toti had found it: a complete wreck with no floor or ceiling. But, as life fell into an endless routine of sawing and drilling, it was slowly transformed. When we finally rolled it out of our old shed, in all its shiny red, cream and blue glory, it was an early sign that we might achieve our dream.

For the Hay-on-Wye date we held auditions at a local theatre, guided by my friends Julie and Michelle Fossett, seventh and eighth generation circus people, mother and daughter. As always, they were immaculately turned out in zebra-print coats, false eyelashes, snakeskin high heel boots, nail varnish and hair pieces. With their help, we recruited an acrobat and a polite gentleman juggler from Cheltenham.

Our first company also included three dancers and Kwabana Lindsay, a solitary, shy man who came alive when he painted his face white, pulled on a starry shirt and danced on a rope while playing the violin.

When we arrived in Hay-on-Wye, we'd spent the last of our money on petrol and wages and had nothing left. But to my amazement all our performances sold out, and we discovered the joy of packed shows. High on exhaustion and exhilaration, our little company did not stop partying for the entire festival. Looking back, creative energy is what our circus has always been about.
In 2005, the show included three Cossack horsemen, one of whom insisted on grooming my very surprised horse Eclipse with our vacuum cleaner. But the real problem was that our two Welsh horses, Red and Rooster, did not adapt easily to the Russian training methods. One morning, Rooster bucked and left one of the Cossacks in the snow, then galloped all around the farm with the other two Russians running after him. Fortunately, these problems were resolved, and horses continue to be a vital part of the show.

For us, animal welfare is essential, so we were surprised when we were once investigated by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which had heard we had illegally acquired a small brown bear. In fact, the creature in question was one of our performers, dressed in a bear outfit. Clearly the endless trips to the costume workshop had paid off...

In early spring each year we put up the tent, so we can work out how the interior will look that season, and by May we move out of the farm.

The circus still casts its spell over me – even more so now I'm mother to four-year old twins. I want their upbringing to be full of the qualities that make our shows so enjoyable: home-made fun and the joyful disruption of everyday life.

I learned the value of these things from my own parents and, although my mother died in December 2013, there is much about Giffords' Circus to remind me of her. Before her accident, she gave me an 18th-century drawing of a young boy riding a horse with a dog running ahead. I loved it and now use it for our logo because it seems to sum up the spirit of our circus – jolly and unpolished. Giffords' Circus is how I travel backwards to my childhood, and how I travel forward, with my family and my art in tow.
