# AI Architect Review: CJ Assessment Service Admin Authentication & Authorization

## Context & Objective

---

## How to Use the Attached Repomix Package

### Package Contents

Attached is `repomix-cj-admin-auth-architecture.xml` containing **31 carefully selected files (56K tokens)** that represent the complete authentication and authorization architecture of the HuleEdu monorepo:

### Reading the XML Package

The repomix XML follows this structure:

```xml
<file_summary>
  <!-- Lists all 31 files with their paths and purposes -->
</file_summary>

<repository_structure>
  <!-- Directory tree showing how files relate -->
</repository_structure>

<files>
  <file path="services/identity_service/api/auth_routes.py">
    <!-- Full file content -->
  </file>
  <!-- ... remaining 30 files -->
</files>
```

**Navigation Tips**:

## GitHub Repository Access

You have access to the HuleEdu monorepo on GitHub: **[https://github.com/olofspangberg/huledu-reboot](https://github.com/olofspangberg/huledu-reboot)**

### When to Access GitHub

**Use the repomix package FIRST** for all analysis - it contains the essential auth architecture. Access GitHub only if you need:

- Additional rule files beyond the 5 included (`.claude/rules/*.md`)
- Test implementations to understand validation patterns
- Migration files for database schema context
- Service README files for operational documentation
- Additional API route examples from other services
